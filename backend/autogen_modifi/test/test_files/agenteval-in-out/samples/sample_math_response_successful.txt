We can do this by iterating through the numbers from 10 to 99 and checking if they are factors of 144. Then, we can sum these factors and print their sum.\n\nHere's a Python script to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ntwo_digit_factors = []\n\nfor i in range(10, 100):\n    if 144 % i == 0:\n        two_digit_factors.append(i)\n\nsum_of_factors = sum(two_digit_factors)\nprint(\"The sum of all the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144 is:\", sum_of_factors)\n```\n\nPlease run this script to find the desired sum.",
