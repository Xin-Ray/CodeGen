As you prepare your critiques, please consider the following dimensions:\n- Are there bugs, logic errors, syntax error or typos in the visualization code? Are there any reasons why the code may fail to run? How should it be fixed?\n- Is the data transformed appropriately for the visualization type? E.g., is the dataset appropriated filtered, aggregated, or grouped  if needed? If a date field is used, is the date field first converted to a date object etc?\n- How well does the code meet the specified visualization goals?\n- CONSIDERING BEST PRACTICES, is the visualization type appropriate for the data and intent? Is there a visualization type that would be more effective in conveying insights? \n- Are the aesthetics of the visualization appropriate for the visualization type and the data?" } } }
